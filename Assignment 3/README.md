## Assignment 3

Description: This folder contains the code for Assignment 3. In this assignment, I attempt to replicate the tables and figures for another group's Assignment 2.
The title of their Assignment 2 was "The association between marital status and serious psychological distress." Using the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS)
2023, they examined the association between marital status and serious psychological distress, while adjusting for key sociodemographic and behavioral factors.
More information about this project can be found in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EPIDEM207-2025-winter-7C5F/.

The code includes the data cleaning step, data dictionary, codebook, and tables 1-3.
